# Java-Shapes

Synopsis

This application calculates the area of a rectangle, square, and triangle.  The application will prompt the user to enter the side lengths of the rectangle, side length of the square, and height and base lenght of the triangle.  Using this data entered the application will output the area of each.  At the end the user is asked if they want to run it again.

Motivation
